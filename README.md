## [Easy Digital Downloads - Shipping Commissions](https://sellcomet.com/downloads/shipping-commissions)

Shipping Commissions for Easy Digital Downloads integrates with Simple Shipping and Commissions, allowing you to easily operate a physical goods marketplace where you only pay your vendors when products are actually “shipped”.

By default, commission records are created for all enabled products when a payment is completed. However, using this extension, any download (or price options) marked as “shippable” will only have commissions processed once the item has been marked as shipped, making it easier for you as a marketplace owner to track which vendors with shipped goods should get paid.

On a daily basis, all orders marked as “shipped” by your vendors will have their corresponding commissions processed.

## Features

* Automatically disables commissions on downloads (or price options) with shipping enabled
* Ignores downloads without shipping and records commissions normally
* Processes and records commissions when the admin marks the payment as “shipped”
* Vendor payments marked as “shipped” will have commissions processed on a daily basis
* Seamless integration with Easy Digital Downloads, Simple Shipping, and Commissions plugins
* Translation-ready and contains a POT file to get you started translating into your native language
* Have a specific use-case? Shipping Commissions includes plenty of developer-ready filters and action hooks to make it possible!
* Developed using the best practices, with security, extensibility, and readability in mind
